    <h1>Where to Eat in Bodrum?</h1>
    <p>Bodrum, the pearl of the Aegean, is not just about sea, sand, and sun. Each corner offers a unique flavor and a place of joy. Whether you want to hang out like a local, go for tourist attractions, or explore cool spots - the choice is yours. A guide to Bodrum's food and drink is from me; exploring is up to you. The list is not arranged by any specific criteria.</p>

        <h2>Breakfast in Bodrum</h2>
        <h3>Asmalı Çardak</h3>
        <p>If you want to enjoy a delightful spread breakfast away from the summer heat, under the shade of orange and tangerine trees, I highly recommend Asmalı Çardak in Yalıkavak. Besides classic breakfast items like cheese and olives, you'll enjoy great jams made from garden-picked fruits, fried dough, lemon-flavored potato fries, and eggs.</p>

        <h3>Kuytu Bahçe</h3>
        <p>Having a lavish breakfast under the shade of mandarin trees is one of the immutable rituals of Bodrum. So, if you're in Bodrum, don't hesitate to make a reservation and head to Kuytu Bahçe in Bitez. Their breakfast offers everything from handmade herb pastries, fresh vine leaves, homemade fragrant jams, eggs, and much more.</p>

        <h3>Limonatta</h3>
        <p>For a pleasant start to the day with warm flatbread, crispy fried dough, and exquisite breakfast items, I definitely recommend visiting Limonatta in Bitez, located in a lush green courtyard.</p>
        <h3>Havva Ana</h3>
        <p>If you're looking for a breakfast that makes you feel like you're at your mother's house, Havva Ana is a great alternative. Notable flavors include bazlama cooked on a griddle, handmade water borek, and deliciously fried zucchini borek.</p>

        <h3>Seval's Place</h3>
        <p>Seval's Place, a charming roadside breakfast spot in Bodrum, adds joy to your breakfast with their garden-picked tomatoes used in menemen (Turkish-style scrambled eggs) and homemade bread. Their homegrown fruit jams are also a highlight.</p>

        <h2>Local Eateries and Traditional Flavors of Bodrum</h2>
        <h3>Kısmet Lokantası</h3>
        <p>For delicious olive oil dishes made with Aegean herbs and fresh home-cooked meals, Kısmet Lokantası is the place to be. Remember, it's a popular eatery, so there might be a chance of running out of food if you go late.</p>

        <h3>Çeyrek Efe</h3>
        <p>One of the first names that come to mind for home cooking in Bodrum is Çeyrek Efe. It's a delightful spot for a leisurely lunch, offering classic flavors from the Aegean cuisine. The menu changes daily.</p>

        <h3>Sakız Ana</h3>
        <p>Sakız Ana is another must-visit for home-cooked meals in Bodrum. Set in a casual setting decorated with Bodrum's iconic bougainvillea, it's known for its legendary dishes like bean rice, stuffed leaves, and milk kadayif.</p>

        <p>One of the newest spots in the center of Bodrum is Müdavim. It's a great alternative if you want to raise a glass against the backdrop of Bodrum Castle and enjoy delicious mezes. Try to match your visit with sunset hours for an even more enjoyable experience.</p>
        <h3>Gemibaşı</h3>
        <p>A definite favorite among Bodrum regulars and locals, Gemibaşı, located on Neyzen Tevfik Street extending to the marina, offers daily specials in addition to its classic menu. If you happen upon their mussel pilaf, don't hesitate to order a double portion – you won't regret it.</p>

        <h3>Ox</h3>

        <h3>Yakamoz Restaurant</h3>
        <p>Located in Kızılağaç village, Yakamoz Restaurant is a favorite haunt for those chasing local flavors and those tired of Bodrum's summer crowds. Be sure to try their 'cırık', a Bodrum-style chicken roast, when you visit.</p>

        <h3>Doy Doy</h3>
        <p>If you're looking for a tranquil seafront spot in a bay like Güvercinlik, give Doy Doy a try. Their appetizers and hot starters are so delightful that you might find it hard to save room for the main course. Choose wisely if you want to enjoy fish among the appetizers.</p>

        <h3>Avlu</h3>
        <p>If you're searching for a sweet spot in Bodrum, located in a quiet alley, Avlu is just right for you. Enjoy your wine or cocktail while savoring fabulous accompaniments. Their shrimp tempura and Albanian liver are among my favorites.</p>

        <h3>Kayıkçı's Place</h3>
        <p>For a delightful fish meal away from Yalıkavak's glitz, by the sea with the sound of waves, Kayıkçı's Place is perfect. I strongly recommend trying their 'Stuffed Zucchini Flowers' and 'Sea Bass in Vine Leaves'.</p>

        <h3>İsmet's Place</h3>
        <p>A favorite not only among locals but also foreign tourists, İsmet's Place on Bitez beach offers a wonderful dining experience right by the sea. What could be more enjoyable than eating at tables set up on the sand?</p>

        <h3>Koyver Frencir</h3>
        <p>Named after a cactus fruit commonly seen in Bodrum, Koyver Frencir offers mouthwatering dishes. Don't miss their warm eggplant, lemon and basil Girit paste, and turmeric fava. The crispy helva served with ice cream at the end is unforgettable.</p>

        <h3>Root</h3>
        <p>One of the newest additions in Bodrum is Root. It's both a delightful beach club and a restaurant with an excellent kitchen. If you want to enjoy the sun and sea all day while indulging in delicious meals, Root is the place to go.</p>

        <h3>Kavanoz</h3>
        <p>If you ask where to find peace and tranquility in Bodrum, Zai is the answer. Enjoy your coffee under the olive trees and let yourself be embraced by serenity. Some evenings at Zai also feature music performances and mini concerts.</p>

        <h3>Dibekli Han</h3>

        <h3>Maride</h3>
        <p>Located on the road in Bitez, Maride is like a lush oasis. With its breezy garden, delicious breakfast, and wonderful pastry flavors, you can stop by Maride just for coffee and dessert.</p>

        <h3>Tadım Nazilli Pidesi</h3>

        <h3>Mantıcı</h3>
        <p>Mantıcı in Bitez is simple and casual, just as its name suggests. You won't get enough of their thin dough, tiny butter-topped dumplings.</p>

        <h2>Desserts in Bodrum</h2>
        <h3>Bitez Ice Cream</h3>
        <p>Although they have several branches, I recommend visiting the central branch in Bitez. All their ice creams are good, but the almond and mastic flavors are definitely my favorites. For those who don't consume sugar, they also offer sugar-free cherry and diabetic alternatives.</p>

        <h3>Türkbükü Natural Ice Cream</h3>
        <p>All the varieties of Türkbükü Natural Ice Cream are delicious, but I recommend trying the fruit ones, especially black mulberry and strawberry. If you're not into fruit ice creams, their chocolate is legendary.</p>

        <h3>Pankery</h3>
        <p>Newly opened in Bitez, Pankery makes bite-sized pancakes that are irresistibly tasty. You can top your pancakes with whatever you like, such as tahini, molasses, or Nutella. They also offer a flourless, sugarless option topped with peanut butter, banana, and hazelnut.</p>

        <h3>Sabriye's Profiterole</h3>
        <p>Sabriye's profiterole, with its delicious chocolate sauce, has a unique dough and cream. The best part is that they are sold like ice cream scoops, so you don't have to buy a whole portion. You can just grab a scoop of profiterole drenched in chocolate sauce and go.</p>

        <h2>Nightlife in Bodrum</h2>
        <h3>Ixir</h3>
        <p>If you want to start your night out or have a great cocktail before dinner, head straight to Ixir without thinking twice. Ixir has also thought about those who are calorie-conscious and prepared 'Skinny' cocktails with calorie counts.</p>

        <h3>Katip</h3>
        <p>Located in a side street in the center of Bodrum, but away from the noise and crowd, Katip is nestled among lemon gardens, serving as both a hotel and a bar-restaurant. It transports you to Sorrento, Italy, famous for its lemons. When you visit Bodrum, don't leave without having a cocktail made by Ayça at Katip.</p>
